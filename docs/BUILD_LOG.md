# Build log

One entry per work session, newest last. Format: date (Prague), what changed, what is next.
This log is the record of what was built during the hackathon (26 Oct to 4 Nov 2026).

## 2026-10-26 (Mon, evening, after kickoff)

- Created the repository scaffold: agent instructions (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`), docs
  (architecture, plan, hackathon reference), Python package skeleton (config, API clients,
  SAM 3.1 helpers, scene manifest schema), smoke tests for Meta Model API and Baseten,
  frame extraction script, Modal reconstruction job skeleton, Spark-based web viewer
  skeleton. Scaffold drafted with AI assistance.
- Checked: unit tests pass; frame extraction works on a test clip; viewer renders the
  synthetic `demo` scene and applies remove/move edits live (headless Chromium).
  Not yet run: Meta API and Baseten smoke tests (keys pending), Modal job.
- Credits: Baseten $100 approved; Meta API claim pending; Modal and Fireworks requested.
- Next: M0 smoke tests, film 3 rooms, first Modal reconstruction run (M1).

## 2026-10-29 (Thu, early afternoon)

- Updated the plan and agent instructions before the first push: the scaffold above was
  generated on 26 Oct but not yet committed; it enters the repository together with these
  changes in the first commit.
- New scope: coverage loop (find gaps, recapture or generate with Muse Image, tag generated
  splats) and on-device rendering on standalone headsets at 72 FPS (per-object LOD trees,
  baked floor and ceiling, budget controller). Nothing from the original plan is cut.
- New rule from Cerebral Valley (28 Oct): every model called at runtime must be a Meta
  model. MapAnything and SAM 3D Objects are listed as Meta open-source models.
- Work now runs in lanes (core, coverage, renderer, lod, bake) with folder ownership in
  `AGENTS.md`; schema sections for lod, coverage and planes added to `scene.py` and
  `scene.ts`.
- Next: R0 device baseline tonight on the Steam Frame and Pico 4; M1 first real room; lane
  sessions for renderer base, per-object LOD, coverage scoring and plane baking.
